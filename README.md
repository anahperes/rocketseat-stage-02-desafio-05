<strong>Rocketseat - Stage 02 / Desafio 05</strong>

I was supposed to develop a webpage from scratch, considering accessibility and semantics.

Though I had already used, I acquired a better understanding on the usage of tags such as &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; and the importance of applying each one on the right context so that things get easily readable and also faster to connect to css styling.

I also researched a bit about "tabindex" and "title" to test it.

The original layout was available for reference <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/HR4b0vlMJPo4HxHpr9nTDP/Explorer-(Copy)?node-id=16-106&t=9DqdL0CMtlWG1d7T-0">here</a>.
